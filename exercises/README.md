# Instructions

Exercises will reinenforce what your are learning from the tutorials and the dates of completion are actually very important.
Please always make the best effort in tackling these challenges.

## Structure

- Run the command git pull to get updated assignment folder, once an exercise is given.
- Create a folder called exercise-solution on the root project folder, this folder would house all exercises solutions.
- Create a javaScript file for each solution according to the exercice name; example `exercise1.2.js`

## Timing

- All exercises should be carried out within the stipulated time located at the top right hand corner of each assignment.
- It is very important to stick to time to avaoid code concept non-reinforcement and overcome coding phobia.

## Ethics

- Try as much as possible to avoid generating code blocks using generative AIs such as cluade and gpts, they kill creativity of beginners and intermediate learners. Only use them for debuging.
- Don't clone a ready made repository, try as much as possible to solve the problem by yourself. Use google, stackoverflow and others.

## Tips

While you solve these problems develop a problem solving framework that helped you the most in achieving success. Document the process and repeat. Happy coding.
